                    <p>The series is based on the legends about the Viking Ragnar Lodbrok, one of the most famous heroes of Norse culture who sacked Northumbria, France and Britain. <br>

                        <br>  The series portrays Lodbrok as a curious warrior and technologically innovative, ambitious and rebellious navigator, who makes his friend Floki build a ship, to launch himself to explore the territories to the west of Scandinavia, disobeying the tribal chief, Count Haraldson, who orders to travel to the this, as every year it happened. <br><br>
                        
                        The series remains faithful to the usual lifestyles of Viking adults of the time, the years in which it is based are the beginnings of the war between the Vikings against the Islamic leaders who wanted to change their religion and later in the series about the war between Vikings and Catholic Europe, which they will defeat with the brutality and intelligence with which they are characterized. <br><br>
                        
                        The series also touches on various romantic themes to give the plot more depth and not just complicate things by making them look like a bunch of warriors without humanity to the public. <br><br>
                        
                        The fight and war scenes are very realistic, quite interesting and artistically done, it is something worthy and with how diverted the history channel is currently, it scares the good work it can do when they want, fortunately it is on netflix to be seen by anyone hour.</p>
